What is your site's primary purpose?

It's to help me learn web development - not just technically, but how to do so with persistence, curiosity, determination, and the ability to handle failure and setbacks.

A secondary reason is share my EDA experience with my cohort buddies, and to show off my super l33t skillz.

Who is your target audience?

Me, my cohort, and maybe one day, someone who's considering giving me a job!

How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?

Blog posts are the bulk of the content, so I want visitors to be able to access and read them easily. I'd like a coherent and attractive layout that works on any device.

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

I'm going to use the skeleton framework and the 'mobile first' method, which will help me keep my code - and therefore my site - lean and efficient, while teaching me valuable new skills.
